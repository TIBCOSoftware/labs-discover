# Case Viewer Mod
This mod is inspired from the "Stop Times Mod" (https://community.tibco.com/wiki/stop-times-mod-tibco-spotfirer), and can be used to display the sequence of activities in a case or variant.


## How to get started
- Execute `npm start`. This will install necessary tools and it will start a development server.
- (Optional) Update `src/mod-manifest.json`
- Start editing, e.g `src/main.js`
