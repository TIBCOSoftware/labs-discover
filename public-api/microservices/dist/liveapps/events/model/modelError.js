/**
 * Event Manager Service
 * TIBCO Cloud(TM) Live Apps maintains an audit trail that records various business events that occur during the lifecycle of a Case - for example, when the Case was started and by whom, or when the Case state or data changed and what that change was.   An __AuditEvent__ is a map of attributes (name/value pairs), which provide the audit details about a specific business event. Each AuditEvent includes the following attributes:  * __key__: Unique key value that identifies this AuditEvent within the audit trail * __id__: The unique identifier of the AuditEvent * __type__: The type of the AuditEvent * __creationTime__: Date and time on which this AuditEvent was created * __message__: Description of the AuditEvent * __messageId__: The identifier for the type of AuditEvent that occurred * __severity__: Severity level of the AuditEvent - for example, AUDIT, WARN or ERROR * __subscriptionId__: The unique identifier of the subscription to which the AuditEvent belongs * _other context-specific attributes_: Provides information relevant to the particular AuditEvent - for example, caseId, processId or userId     The TIBCO(R) Live Apps Event Manager Service allows you to retrieve AuditEvents for a specific Case. An audit trail is represented by a series of AuditEvents.  __Note__: An AuditEvent is only stored for a specific period of time (the AuditRetentionPeriod), which is defined for the subscription. An AuditEvent is removed when this period has expired.
