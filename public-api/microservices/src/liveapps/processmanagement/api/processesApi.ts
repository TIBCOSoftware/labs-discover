/**
 * Business Process Management Service
 * The TIBCO(R) Live Apps Business Process Management Service manages the following resources:  * __Case Creator processes__: A Case Creator process is a process definition containing the business logic used to create a Case - this may simply be a single step process that provides a form for a user to complete, or a more involved sequence of steps. An application designer creates at least one Case Creator process when they create an application in Live Apps Designer. A user creates a Process Instance when they use Live Apps Case Manager to start a Case.     * __Case Action processes__: A Case Action process is a process definition containing the business logic used to execute some sort of unscheduled action on an active Case. An application designer creates as many Case Action processes as they need when they create an application in Live Apps Designer. A user creates a Process Instance when they use Live Apps Case Manager to execute an Action on an existing Case.    * __Process Instances__: A Process Instance is a particular instance of a Case Creator process or a Case Action process.   * Process Instance __States__: A Process Instance is, at any time, in one of the following States: STARTED, ACTIVE, COMPLETED, DELAYED, CANCELLED, HALTED or UNKNOWN. Process Instance States are system-defined values representing logical stages in the lifecycle of a process and are used by every Process Instance.     Note: Process Instance States should not be confused with Case states, which are application-defined values representing logical stages in the lifecycle of a Case. An application designer creates whatever Case states they need when they create an application in Live Apps Designer. They can configure the application to only allow users to execute a particular Case Action (that is, start a Process Instance of a Case Action process) when a Case is in a particular (Case) state.

     * This method can be used to:  * Create a new Case (creating an instance of a Case Creator process).  * Update an existing Case by performing a specific action (creating an instance of a Case Action process). Note: The calling User must have the appropriate permissions to execute the requested action.          Any data required to start the process can also be supplied.  In each case, you can obtain the necessary details of the process to be started from the GET /types and GET /cases methods in the Case Manager service. 
     * @summary Creates an instance of a specified Case Creator or Case Action process.
     * @param details A \&#39;ProcessDetails\&#39; object containing:   * __id__ (required): The id of the Case Creator process or Case Action process from which you want to start a Process Instance. (You can obtain this id by using the GET /types method in the Case Manager Service.)   * __applicationId__ (required): The id of the application that contains the specified Case Creator process or Case Action process. (You can obtain the applicationId by using the GET /types method in the Case Manager Service.)   * __sandboxId__ (required): The id of the Sandbox containing the specified applicationId. (You can obtain the sandboxId by using the GET /sandboxes method in the Authorization Engine Service.)   * __caseReference__ (optional - but see Note below): The Case reference of an existing Case for which you want to start a Case Action Process Instance. (You can obtain the caseReference by using the GET /cases method in the Case Manager Service.)     Note:       * A \&#39;caseReference\&#39; is __required__ when starting an Instance of a Case Action process, otherwise a 400 error is returned.       * If you supply a \&#39;caseReference\&#39; when starting an Instance of a Case Creator process, a 400 error is returned.    * __data__ (optional): The data that you wish to supply when starting the Process Instance. This data must conform to the JSON schema of the Case Creator process or Case Action process that you are starting. (You can obtain that JSON schema by using the GET /types method in the Case Manager Service.)
