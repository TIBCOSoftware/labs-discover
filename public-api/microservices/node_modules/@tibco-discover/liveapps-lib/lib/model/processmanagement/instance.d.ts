/**
 * Business Process Management Service
 * The TIBCO(R) Live Apps Business Process Management Service manages the following resources:  * __Case Creator processes__: A Case Creator process is a process definition containing the business logic used to create a Case - this may simply be a single step process that provides a form for a user to complete, or a more involved sequence of steps. An application designer creates at least one Case Creator process when they create an application in Live Apps Designer. A user creates a Process Instance when they use Live Apps Case Manager to start a Case.     * __Case Action processes__: A Case Action process is a process definition containing the business logic used to execute some sort of unscheduled action on an active Case. An application designer creates as many Case Action processes as they need when they create an application in Live Apps Designer. A user creates a Process Instance when they use Live Apps Case Manager to execute an Action on an existing Case.    * __Process Instances__: A Process Instance is a particular instance of a Case Creator process or a Case Action process.   * Process Instance __States__: A Process Instance is, at any time, in one of the following States: STARTED, ACTIVE, COMPLETED, DELAYED, CANCELLED, HALTED or UNKNOWN. Process Instance States are system-defined values representing logical stages in the lifecycle of a process and are used by every Process Instance.     Note: Process Instance States should not be confused with Case states, which are application-defined values representing logical stages in the lifecycle of a Case. An application designer creates whatever Case states they need when they create an application in Live Apps Designer. They can configure the application to only allow users to execute a particular Case Action (that is, start a Process Instance of a Case Action process) when a Case is in a particular (Case) state.
