  but process mining only needs <strong>three key attributes: </strong>

   <ul>
   <li>a case ID (unique identifier)</li>
   <li>a timestamp</li>
   <li> an activity name</li>
 </ul> 
 These three attributes represent “an activity performed at a point in time, as part of a single case or process”. 


<p>
  Once this information is provided, process mining analyzes, correlates, and reconciles this data , 
  and provides graph-based views of the results to business process stakeholders, 
  who can then start the exploration and insight discovery process.
