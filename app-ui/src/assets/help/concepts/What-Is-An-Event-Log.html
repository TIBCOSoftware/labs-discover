</style><p>An event log can include a variety of information but must always have these <strong>three
  attributes</strong>:
<ul>
  <li>Case ID (unique identifier)</li>
  <li>Timestamp</li>
  <li>Activity name</li>
</ul>
These attributes represent an activity performed at a particular point in time as part of an individual case or process.
<p>
  In process mining, event log data is analyzed, correlated, and reconciled, and visualizations are presented to help
  business stakeholders so they get a full picture of the process and its effects.
