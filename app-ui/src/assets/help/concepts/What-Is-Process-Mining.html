  Instead of reading a process diagram that is likely out of date, or performing lengthy and time-consuming interviews with the people involved in process execution, 
  process mining leverages <strong>Event Log Data</strong> and analytical techniques to intelligently process data that is already produced by operational systems. </p>

  Whether the data source is a system or application supporting an operator, 
  data produced by IoT devices, data sitting in a database, or data stored in a data lake, 
  that data is available to whomever is able to connect to it.  
  Process mining focuses on this event log data in order to run in a semi-automated way.
