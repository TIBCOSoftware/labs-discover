</style><p>Process mining is a data-driven approach to discovering and understanding operational processes. Instead of
  relying on static process diagrams or performing time-consuming interviews with the people involved in process
  execution, you can use process mining to intelligently leverage the data thatâ€™s already produced by operational
  systems. Because process mining focuses on <strong>event log data</strong>, discovery and processing can operate in a
  semi-automated
  way.</p>
<p>
  A data source can be a system or application supporting an operator, data produced by IoT devices, data in a database,
  or data stored in a data lake. The key requirement is that the processing mining application must be able to connect
  to and access the data.
