  Process mining allows you to identify anomalies, bottlenecks, compliance issues, and to provide recommendations for solving any discovered issues.
</p>
<p>

  Once identified counter measures are in place, the process mining analysis can be rerun to track and measure the impact of the changes.
  In fact, process mining should not be thought of as a one-off project, but more as a continuous process hygiene helping the business.

<p>
  Given the critical nature of processes in digital transformation programs, 
  process mining can often be seen as the first step towards optimization, given its ability to discover, at scale, 
  how processes are effectively running, before reengineering them.

Process mining gives business two things 
<ul>
  <li>Objectivity</li>
  <li>Direction</li>
</ul> It helps you quantify the inefficiencies and tell you what to change first, for maximum impact and cost saving to the business.
