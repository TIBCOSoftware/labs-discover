  An <strong>investigation</strong> is a case thatâ€™s initiated as a result of a negative finding in the process mining analysis. It
  represents an issue or potential area of improvement that should be reported to case resolvers. A typical
  investigation follows a process that includes initial verification, investigation of the root cause, qualification of
  the issue (confirmed or false positive), and resolution in the form of countermeasures that are implemented and then
  checked again in the next round of process mining.
