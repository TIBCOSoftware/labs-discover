  <p>Yes. The variants table in the Compliance tab contains a <strong>Status</strong> column allowing you to track the status of that variant inspection.
    The status is one of:
    <li>unchecked (default) Enabled by clicking on the "Uncheck" button</li> 
    <li>checked: means inspected. Enabled by clicking on the "Check" button.</li> 
    <li>Compliance or Improvement: Means an investigation has been raised.</li> 
    In case an investigation is created, you can find tracking information in the next two columns
    <li>Case Type</li>: subject of the case (eg. Variant) 
    <li>Case Status</li>: status of the case in the case management component.
