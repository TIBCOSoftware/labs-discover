<p>Datasets can be very large, depending on the underlying data source.</p>
<p>When creating or editing a dataset, the Preview step allows you to preview the first 50 lines of the data source.</p>
<p>When creating a process analysis, you can access the data summary dashboard, which includes data distributions and
  metrics. If the data source is a TIBCO data visualization from an external system, the data is updated when you
  refresh the preview.
