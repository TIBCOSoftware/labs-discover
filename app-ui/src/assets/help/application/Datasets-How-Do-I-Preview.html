  <p>Datasets can be very large, depending on the underlying data source.  
    The  <strong>Preview</strong> feature allows you to do the folllowing :
  <li>During the creation or Editing of dataset, you can preview a sample of the data, typically the first 50 lines</li>
  <li>During the Creation of the new Process analysis, you can access a data summary dashboard, including data distributions and metrics.</li>
  </p>
  <p>At anytime, you can refresh the preview, in order to match the latest data, especially if the underlying data source is a data view connected to external systems.
