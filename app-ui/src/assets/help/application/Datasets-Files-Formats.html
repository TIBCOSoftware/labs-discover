  <p>Upload your files in <strong>Well formed CSV Format</strong> only</p>
  <p> Please note that zip files are not supported.  </P>

    <p> CSV looks easy, but it can be hard to make a CSV file that other people can work with

    </p>
    <p>
      Good CSVs look like this:
      <h6>
      "OrganisationId,WeekDay","Times","IsOpen","OpeningTimeType"
      "1186","Monday","09:30-13:00","True","General"
      "1186","Monday","13:30-17:30","True","General"
      ...
    </h6>
    </p>
    <p> There are some online services (eg. Lint) that can help you validate your CSV files. </p>
      <p>Here are some guidelines 
      <li>The first row is a header row that contains the names of some columns.</li>
      <li>The rest of the rows are data rows that contain a number of fields.</li>
      <li>Line endings use CRLF (Windows line endings) and the column names and fields are separated by commas.</li>
      <li>If a field contains a comma, a line ending or a double quote then the field is escaped by wrapping it in double quotes. 
        Within a field that's escaped like that, any double quotes are doubled up. </li>
