<p>Source files must be in CSV format. Zip files arenâ€™t supported.
</p>
<p> The CSV file must include a header row containing the field (column) names, as in the example below. Use Windows
  line ending (CRLF) to end each line. Use double quotes to enclose field names that contain a comma, multiple words,
  line ending, or double quotes.
</p>
<p>
  Sample CSV file:
</p>
<h6>
  "OrganisationId,WeekDay","Times","IsOpen","OpeningTimeType"
  "1186","Monday","09:30-13:00","True","General"
  "1186","Monday","13:30-17:30","True","General"
  ...
</h6>

<p> There are some online services (eg. Lint) that can help you validate your CSV files. </p>
<p>Here are some guidelines
<li>The first row is a header row that contains the names of some columns.</li>
<li>The rest of the rows are data rows that contain a number of fields.</li>
<li>Line endings use CRLF (Windows line endings) and the column names and fields are separated by commas.</li>
<li>If a field contains a comma, a line ending or a double quote then the field is escaped by wrapping it in double
  quotes.
  Within a field that's escaped like that, any double quotes are doubled up.
</li>
