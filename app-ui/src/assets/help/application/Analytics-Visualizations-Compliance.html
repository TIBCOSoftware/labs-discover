<p><strong>Compliance checking</strong> can be done after a <strong>reference model</strong> is set.
</p>
<p>A variant is considered non-compliant if it doesn't follow any of the variants that constitute the reference model.
  Only the paths are considered for compliance checking.
</p>

<li>The level of non-compliance is shown as a number of variants and as a percentage of cases that aren't compliant with
  the reference set.
</li>
<li>A table lists all non compliant variants, which can be sorted by columns.
</li>
<li>A visual representation shows the differences between the reference model and a selected non-compliant variant.
</li>
<li>The degree of non-compliance is shown as the difference between the variant (row) and the reference model.
</li>
<li>Number of cases and duration metrics are shown.
</li>
<br>
<p>
  Select a <strong>variant</strong> in the table and perform any of <strong>the following actions:</strong></p>
<li>Visualize the process compared to the reference model.
</li>
<li>Mark the variant so the next time you open the analysis you donâ€™t need to inspect it again.
</li>
<li>Raise an investigation so the non-compliance can be escalated and validated and the root problem can be resolved.
</li>
<li>Track the status of the investigation.</li>
