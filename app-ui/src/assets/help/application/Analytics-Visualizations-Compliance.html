  <p><strong>Compliance checking</strong> can be done after a <strong>reference model</strong> is set. </p>

  <p>A variant is qualified as non compliant if it doesn't follow any of the variants that constitute the reference model. 
    Only the paths are considered for compliance checking.</p>
    What you can see at a glance is 
    <li>The level of non compliance in the form of the number of variants, and % of cases that aren't compliant with the reference set. </li>
    <li>A table showing all non compliant variants
     <li>A visual representation of the differences between the reference model and a selected non compliant variant</li> 
      
 </p>

 <p>
   The table of non compliant variants can be sorted by any of these columns:
   <li>Degree of non compliance, expressed as the number of difference between the variant (row) and the reference model</li>
   <li>Number of cases</li>
   <li>Duration metrics</li>
 </p>

 <p>
   You can select a variant in the table and perform the following actions 
   <li>Visualize the process compared to the reference model.   </li>
   <li>Mark the variant as checked so that next time you open the analysis you won't need to inspect it again. </li>
   <li>Raise an investigation so that the non compliance can be escalated, validated and the root cause problem resolved so that it doesn't occur again in the future.</li>
  <li>Track the status of the investigation</li>
