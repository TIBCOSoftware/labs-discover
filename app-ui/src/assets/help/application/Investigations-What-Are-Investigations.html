  <p>An  <strong>investigation</strong> is a result of a negative finding in the process mining analysis.
    Ir represents an issue, or a potential area of improvement, that cannot be ignored and needs to be reported to case resolvers.
    A typical investigation follows a process that start from initial verification, investigation of the root cause, qualification of the issue (confirmed or false positive)
    and finally a resolution in the form of counter measures that will take effect and be checked again in the next round of procss mining.
