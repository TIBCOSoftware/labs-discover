<p>This set of visualizations, also known as social mining, focuses on <strong>resources</strong>. The purpose is to
  discover patterns related to how resources are involved and interact with each other in processes.
</p>
<p>The table lists resources ranked by number of activities performed. Select one or more resources to see details,
  including the list of activities performed by the selected resource.
</p>
<p>The graph represents <strong>resources</strong> as nodes and <strong>connections</strong> as edges. A connection
  between two resources represents two
  consecutive activities in the same case. An edge can represent multiple connections for one or more cases.
</p>
<p>The filter panel allows you to filter the resources and connections.</p>
