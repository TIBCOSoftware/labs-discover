  <p>In this step, you need to tell us the <strong>format of the datetime</strong> column, so that we can parse it.
    We try to guess the format and give you the final word to confirm it.
  </p>
  <p> In case of <strong>ambiguity</strong>, we propose you the list of possible matching formats, 
    and we suggest you browse more rows in the data source in order to remove the ambiguity.
    An example of such ambiguity is: 1/2/2020: you cannot tell which number is the month and which number is the day.
    But if you read more lines you may find 1/25/2020 which indicates the the month is first.
