    For example you can 
  <li>Change visualizations (eg. from bar chart to line chart)</li>
  <li>Add or remove visualizations, for example to best represent custom attributes such as a regional attribute best represented on a map chart.  </li>
  <li>Add more data sources, correlated with the business processes, such as CRM data. You can then define relations between the data tables</li>
  <li>add more data preparation, data science, AI/ML</li>
  <li>Add or remove tabs</li>
