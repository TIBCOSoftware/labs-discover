  <p>You can use your own managed TIBCO Data Virtualization and bring your data to the solution. 

    Use this setting screen to configure: 
    <li>The URL and port of the Business Directory Server. Note that a proxy is needed to allow the Web Application to access Business Directory APIs 
      hosted on a different domain. Configure that proxy to allow CORS headers.
    </li>
    <li>The  port of your TDV Server. Please remember to white list the IP address of your TDV server so that it can be reached from the backend. 
      The hostname of your TDV server is not needed here because it is provided dynamically by the Business Directory Server as you pick views. </li> 

    <li>Username and password to access the above.</li>
