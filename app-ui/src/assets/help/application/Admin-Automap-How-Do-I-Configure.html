<p>The auto mapper doesnâ€™t require any configuration. It automatically collects and stores mappings that you define in
  your analyses. But you can make changes on the Auto map settings page or reset the values of mappings that were
  previously used. The auto mapper looks for similarities between the key words and the column names found in your
  datasets.</p>
