<p>When an analysis is in the <strong>‘Not ready’</strong> state, it means that something prevented it from running the
  process mining job successfully.
</p>
<p>In such a situation, we recommend the following:</p>
<li><strong>Read the error message</strong> by hovering around the "Not ready" status column for the analysis.</li>
<li>Read the help section on most common mistakes and see whether some solutions are suggested.</li>
<li>Fix the underlying problem, which is often related to the dataset or mappings.</li>
<li>Rerun the analysis. On the Process Analysis page, click the More icon (...) and select <strong>Rerun.</li>
