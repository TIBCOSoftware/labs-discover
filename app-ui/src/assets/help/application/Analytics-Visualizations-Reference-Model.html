<p>The <strong>reference model</strong> is the set of best practices or compliance rules to follow.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:
<li>Initially the reference model is empty.
</li>
<li>As you discover variants, you can add them to the reference model.
</li>
<li>The reference model persists in the backend and appears the next time you open the analysis.
</li>
<li>You can check case compliance against the reference set.
</li>
<li>You can add or remove variants from the reference model at any time.
</li>
<li>Setting the reference model doesnâ€™t require any modeling. Instead, it follows a discovery approach, expecting the
  data and cases to contain at least one occurrence of a variant.
</li>
