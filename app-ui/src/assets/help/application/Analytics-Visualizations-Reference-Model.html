  <p>The <strong>reference model</strong> is the set of best practices or compliance rules to follow. </p>

  <p>Here's how it works:
    <li>Initially the reference model is empty.</li>
    <li>As you discover variants, you can Add one or more to the reference model.</li>
    <li>The reference model is then persisted in the backend, therefore next time you open the analysis it will appear.</li>
    <li>Once set, you can check compliance of the cases against that reference set.</li>
    <li>At any time, you can add/remove variants from the reference model.</li>
  </p>

  <p>
  Setting the reference model does not require any modeling. 
  Instead, it follows a discovery approach, expecting the data and cases to contain at least one occurrence of them.
