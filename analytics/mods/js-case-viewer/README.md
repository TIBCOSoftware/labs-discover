# Mod starter project
This is a mod template project. It contains the minimum amount of code necessary to run a working mod.  

For an example on how to develop a mod by using this starter project see  _"A step-by-step Tutorial on using Spotfire Mods"_ in the documentaion.


## How to get started
- Execute `npm start`. This will install necessary tools and it will start a development server.
- (Optional) Update `src/mod-manifest.json`
- Start editing, e.g `src/main.js`
